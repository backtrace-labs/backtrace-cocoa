1. In the Dependency Rule list specify the Branch as `SwiftPM`, then click Add Package.
1. Verify your project Package Dependencies list backtrace-cocoa.
1. Be sure to add Backtrace to your targetâ€™s Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content.

### Via Package.swift
Add this dependency to your `Package.swift` file:
```
.package(url: "https://github.com/backtrace-labs/backtrace-cocoa.git, branch: "feature/SwiftPM")
```
